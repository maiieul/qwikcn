## October 2023 - New-York style components

Qwikcn now has most New-York style components natively rewritten in Qwik.

This includes:

- [accordion](/docs/components/accordion)
- [alert](/docs/components/alert)
- [aspect-ratio](/docs/components/aspect-ratio)
- [badge](/docs/components/badge)
- [button](/docs/components/button)
- [card](/docs/components/card)
- [checkbox](/docs/components/checkbox)
- [input](/docs/components/input)
- [label](/docs/components/label)
- [separator](/docs/components/separator)
- [skeleton](/docs/components/skeleton)
- [tabs](/docs/components/tabs)
- [textarea](/docs/components/textarea)

Because there are still quite a few headless components that don't yet exist in Qwik, some components are rewritten to use vanilla HTML, others are qwikified (with `qwikify$`), and some will require you to use shadcn's React components and to qwikify them yourself (My priority now will be to help qwik-ui to get these headless components ready).

Vanilla HTML components (similar shadcn API):

- [avatar](/docs/components/avatar)
- [collapsible](/docs/components/collapsible)
- [radio-group](/docs/components/radio-group)
- [select](/docs/components/select)
- [slider](/docs/components/slider)
- [switch](/docs/components/switch)
- [toggle](/docs/components/toggle)

Qwikified components (similar shadcn API):

- [calendar](/docs/components/calendar)
- [combobox](/docs/components/combobox)
- [progress](/docs/components/progress)
- [scroll-area](/docs/components/scroll-area)
- [toaster](/docs/components/toaster)

React components (a common pattern to these components and why they are harder to port to Qwik is that they are composable with multiple sub-components):

- [alert-dialog](/docs/components/alert-dialog)
- [command](/docs/components/command)
- [context-menu](/docs/components/context-menu)
- [dialog](/docs/components/dialog)
- [dropdown-menu](/docs/components/dropdown-menu)
- [hover-card](/docs/components/hover-card)
- [menubar](/docs/components/menubar)
- [navigation-menu](/docs/components/navigation-menu)
- [popover](/docs/components/popover)
- [sheet](/docs/components/sheet)
- [table](/docs/components/table)
- [toast](/docs/components/toast)
- [tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip)

> If you are not comfortable at qwikifying those React components yourself, I would recommend to wait for the most common ones to be available in qwik-ui before using qwikcn.
